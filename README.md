# Good Job! Media - Batch Script Repository
You can find all of Good Job! Media's batch scripts, in their various states of completion, stored here.

They are constantly updated to correct any mistakes or deficiencies we may take note of, and can also include pull requests from any Git and/or Aegisub-savvy viewer.

These scripts are free for use by anyone, but we request that you appropriately credit Good Job! Media when using them for a project aimed at the public domain. Your compliance with this request is greatly appreciated.

If you're an experienced subtitler who is looking for an environment that values a solid work ethic and produces the proper results, contact Fyurie or any other staff member via IRC at [#gjm-recruits@irc.rizon.net](irc://irc.rizon.net/gjm-recruits) or [#goodjob@irc.rizon.net](irc://irc.rizon.net/goodjob). You can also find us through [Discord](http://discord.gg/hQewDqS).
